## Machine Translate with Keras
  Machine translation application from English to Turkish with LSTM.
  
  We will create our machine translation model by creating our own Encoder and Decoder models with this application. Both our Encoder and Decoder models have 3 LSTM layers.

  I couldn't add it to the repo because the size of the data used for training was too high. For data, you can send an e-mail to serkanars@protonmail.com.

## Requirements
  * Python 3.6.9
  * Tensorflow 1.14.0
